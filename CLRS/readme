Another computer science classics...

I learned data structures and algorithms through MOOCs and leetcode. They definitely are very helpful, for example, I can solve common problems without much issues, but the limit is that when the problems get harder I am stuck at coming up a "correct" solution. In How to Solve It, Polya said 

"""
Intuitive insight and formal proof are two different ways of perceiving the truth, comparable to the perception of a material object through two different senses, sight and touch. 

Intuitive insight may rush far ahead of formal proof.

Formal manipulation of logical rules and algebraic formulas may get far ahead of intuition. Almost everybody can see at once that 3 straight lines, taken at random, divide the plane into 7 parts. Scarcely anybody is able to see, even training his attention to the utmost, that 5 planes, taken at random, divide space into 26 parts. Yet it can be rigidly proved that the right number is 26, and the proof is not even long or difficult.
"""

I find the lack of the training of formal proof in algorithms problems limits my ability to come up with correct and efficient algorithms. That's why I look forward to Graduate Algorithm in OMSCS program.. But before I take that class, I can practice on my own here.
