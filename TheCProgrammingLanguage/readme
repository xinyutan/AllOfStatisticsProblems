I am [conditionally] accepted by the GaTech OMSCS program. The first class I want to take, Introduction to Operating Systems, requires a good knowledge in C language. To think a little bit further, I plan to take 4 classes that would use C and C++ in the projects.

 I learned C more than 10 years ago, and never used it seriously. Hence, before the semester starts, I plan to read this book. Plus, this book is a classics in computer science. I like to read classics in all subjects. This is a perfect opportunity.

I also try to familarize myself with C++ by working through udacity's C++ nano degree.

I am really excited about and thankful for OMSCS program... I expect to learn a lot and to be a more thoughtful engineer!
